# penn-weather-energy-usage
A project that seeks to model energy usage in buildings on Penn's campus using weather data.

This project uses weather data from the past 5 years in the Philadelphia area to predict electricity, steam, and chilled water usage for buildings on Penn's campus. This has a number of managerial implications -- a building that uses much more steam energy than the model expects could have a faulty gauge or a valve leak, for example. All of the code for the project should be in the Python notebook

This project was completed with Alex Waegel and Stephen Rothstein.
